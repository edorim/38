# 💨 Fart Intelligence LLM Evolution Lab

A multimodal machine learning project for:
- Detecting fart sounds from audio (CNN classifier)
- Generating and labeling synthetic farts
- Using LLMs to describe, classify, and compete over fart logic
- Evolving prompts and models based on fitness
- Protecting against adversarial fake farts

---

## 🧱 Architecture
- CNN audio classifier (PyTorch + torchaudio)
- Synthetic audio generator
- LLM reasoning layer (OpenRouter, HuggingFace, Groq)
- Prompt mutation + evolution loop
- Adversarial detection filter
- Continuous learning from real + synthetic audio
